				<p>Worldwide Shipping LLC is a family owned and operated transport brokerage located in South Florida. We are dedicated to providing honest and reliable service at affordable rates. We are one of the few auto transport companies in this industry where you work directly with the owners; not an irritating sales agent or uninterested customer service rep. We can assure you that when you call us, you’ll receive expert advice every time. We take great pride in each customer’s satisfaction. Your willingness to use us again in the future is our objective.</p>
				<p>All of our vehicle carriers are pre-screened to ensure that you are in contact with only the most reputable carriers in the industry. There are thousands ofDepartment of Transportation (DOT) registered auto transporters on the market, however a high percentage of those transporters have been rated very poorly in the past, and are now quite desperate to find a vehicle to ship. The majority of brokers purposely choose a poorly rated carrier to make a bigger brokers fee, thus leaving the client with missed pick up/delivery dates, uninsured damages to their vehicle, and an overall lack of customer service. </p>
				<p>Here at Worldwide Shipping LLC, we will only select a carrier for you if they have a 98% rating (or higher), and at least 3 years experience. This way, we only provide you with the safest, most reputable auto transporters in the nation. We have pre-selected the top auto transport companies so they can compete for your business, insuring you receive the best service at the best possible price.</p>

					<li>Repeat Client Discounts</li>

				<p>Whether you need to transport a vehicle to the next town or across the world, Worldwide Shipping LLC makes it easy and convenient with both domestic and international services. Our prices are among the most competitive of all reputable vehicle transporters in the industry. Our goal is not to be the largest company, but to be the one that provides excellence and integrity in an industry that lacks both.</p>
